{"text": "<s> the admitted familiarity of Miss Austen with Madame D'Arblay's work, it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> has been concluded that Miss Austen borrowed from _Cecilia_, the title of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her second novel. But here comes in the little problem to which we have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> referred. _Pride and Prejudice_ it is true, was written and finished\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> before _Sense and Sensibility_--its original title for several years being\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _First Impressions_. Then, in 1797, the author fell to work upon an older\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> essay in letters _a la_ Richardson, called _Elinor and Marianne_, which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she re-christened _Sense and Sensibility._ This, as we know, was her first\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> published book; and whatever may be the connection between the title of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _Pride and Prejudice_ and the passage in _Cecilia_, there is an obvious\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> connection between the title of _Pride and Prejudice_ and the _title of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Sense and Sensibility_. If Miss Austen re-christened _Elinor and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne_ before she changed the title of _First Impressions_, as she well\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> may have, it is extremely unlikely that the name of _Pride and Prejudice_\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> has anything to do with _Cecilia_ (which, besides, had been published at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> least twenty years before). Upon the whole, therefore, it is most likely\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that the passage in Madame D'Arblay is a mere coincidence; and that in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _Sense and Sensibility_, as well as in the novel that succeeded it in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> publication, Miss Austen, after the fashion of the old morality plays,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> simply substituted the leading characteristics of her principal personages\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for their names. Indeed, in _Sense and Sensibility_ the sense of Elinor,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and the sensibility (or rather _sensiblerie_) of Marianne, are markedly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> emphasised in the opening pages of the book But Miss Austen subsequently,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and, as we think, wisely, discarded in her remaining efforts the cheap\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attraction of an alliterative title. _Emma_ and _Persuasion, Northanger\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Abbey_ and _Mansfield Park_, are names far more in consonance with the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> quiet tone of her easy and unobtrusive art.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _Elinor and Marianne_ was originally written about 1792. After the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> completion--or partial completion, for it was again revised in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> 1811--of _First Impressions_ (subsequently _Pride and Prejudice_),\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Miss Austen set about recasting _Elinor and Marianne_, then composed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in the form of letters; and she had no sooner accomplished this task,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> than she began _Northanger Abbey_. It would be interesting to know to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> what extent she remodelled _Sense and Sensibility_ in 1797-98, for we\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> are told that previous to its publication in 1811 she again devoted a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> considerable time to its preparation for the press, and it is clear\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that this does not mean the correction of proofs alone, but also a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> preliminary revision of MS. Especially would it be interesting if we\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could ascertain whether any of its more finished passages, _e.g._ the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> admirable conversation between the Miss Dashwoods and Willoughby in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> chapter x., were the result of those fallow and apparently barren\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Brabourne in 1884 only reveals two definite references to _Sense and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Sensibility_ and these are absolutely unfruitful in suggestion. In\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> April 1811 she speaks of having corrected two sheets of 'S and S,'\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which she has scarcely a hope of getting out in the following June;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and in September, an extract from the diary of another member of the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> family indirectly discloses the fact that the book had by that time\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been published. This extract is a brief reference to a letter which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> had been received from Cassandra Austen, begging her correspondent not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to mention that Aunt Jane wrote _Sense and Sensibility._ Beyond these\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> minute items of information, and the statement--already referred to in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the Introduction to _Pride and Prejudice_--that she considered herself\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> overpaid for the labour she had bestowed upon it, absolutely nothing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> seems to have been preserved by her descendants respecting her first\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> printed effort. In the absence of particulars some of her critics have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> fallen to speculate upon the reason which made her select it, and not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _Pride and Prejudice_, for her debut; and they have, perhaps\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> naturally, found in the fact a fresh confirmation of that traditional\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> blindness of authors to their own best work, which is one of the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> commonplaces of literary history. But this is to premise that she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _did_ regard it as her masterpiece, a fact which, apart from this\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> accident of priority of issue, is, as far as we are aware, nowhere\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> asserted. A simpler solution is probably that, of the three novels she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> had written or sketched by 1811, _Pride and Prejudice_ was languishing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> under the stigma of having been refused by one bookseller without the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> formality of inspection, while _Northanger Abbey_ was lying _perdu_ in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> another bookseller's drawer at Bath. In these circumstances it is\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> intelligible that she should turn to _Sense and Sensibility_, when, at\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> spring of 1811--Mr. T. Egerton of the 'Military Library,' Whitehall,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> By the time _Sense and Sensibility_ left the press, Miss Austen was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> again domiciled at Chawton Cottage. For those accustomed to the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> swarming reviews of our day, with their Babel of notices, it may seem\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> strange that there should be no record of the effect produced, seeing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that, as already stated, the book sold well enough to enable its\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> putter-forth to hand over to its author what Mr. Gargery, in _Great\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Expectations_, would have described as 'a cool L150.' Surely Mr.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Egerton, who had visited Miss Austen at Sloane Street, must have later\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conveyed to her some intelligence of the way in which her work had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been welcomed by the public. But if he did, it is no longer\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> discoverable. Mr. Austen Leigh, her first and best biographer, could\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> find no account either of the publication or of the author's feelings\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thereupon. As far as it is possible to judge, the critical verdicts\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she obtained were mainly derived from her own relatives and intimate\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> friends, and some of these latter--if one may trust a little anthology\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which she herself collected, and from which Mr. Austen Leigh prints\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> extracts--must have been more often exasperating than sympathetic. The\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> long chorus of intelligent approval by which she was afterwards\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> 'fit audience' during her lifetime must have been emphatically 'few,'\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Of two criticisms which came out in the _Quarterly_ early in the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> review _Emma_, though he also gives brief summaries of _Sense and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Sensibility_ and _Pride and Prejudice_. Mr. Austen Leigh, we think,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> speaks too contemptuously of this initial notice of 1815. If, at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> certain points, it is half-hearted and inadequate, it is still fairly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> accurate in its recognition of Miss Austen's supreme merit, as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> contrasted with her contemporaries--to wit, her skill in investing the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> fortunes of ordinary characters and the narrative of common\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> occurrences with all the sustained excitement of romance. The Reviewer\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> points out very justly that this kind of work, 'being deprived of all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that, according to Bayes, goes \"to elevate and surprise,\" must make\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> amends by displaying depth of knowledge and dexterity of execution.'\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> her fine irony, and the delicacy of her artistic touch, something must\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be allowed for the hesitations and reservations which invariably beset\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the critical pioneer.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> To contend, however, for a moment that the present volume is Miss\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> mere exercise in paradox. There are, who swear by _Persuasion_; there\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> are, who prefer _Emma_ and _Mansfield Park_; there is a large\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> contingent for _Pride and Prejudice_; and there is even a section\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which advocates the pre-eminence of _Northanger Abbey_. But no one, as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> far as we can remember, has ever put _Sense and Sensibility_ first,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nor can we believe that its author did so herself. And yet it is she\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> the handsome and amiable Jane Bennet rather better than the obsolete\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> survival of the sentimental novel represented by Marianne Dashwood.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Darcy and Bingley again are much more 'likeable' (to use Lady\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> stiff-jointed Colonel Brandon. Yet it might not unfairly be contended\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> CHAPTER I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> children added a relish to his existence.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> child, and he had only a life-interest in it.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew; but\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and daughters than for himself or his son; but to his son, and his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for his widow and daughters.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> might prudently be in his power to do for them.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> [Illustration: _His son's son, a child of four years old._]\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> have been made still more respectable than he was: he might even have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of himself; more narrow-minded and selfish.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> heart, and made him feel capable of generosity. \"Yes, he would give\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\" He\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not repent.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> feelings, must have been highly unpleasing. But in _her_ mind there\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> source of immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> opportunity, till the present, of showing them with how little\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> required it.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a breach with their brother.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to imprudence. She had an excellent heart; her disposition was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> joys, could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> interesting: she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her and her mother was strikingly great.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; but\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> other now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for, was created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> struggle, she could exert herself. She could consult with her brother,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> proper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> without having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> CHAPTER II\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> beyond himself, his wife, and their child. He really pressed them,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> invitation was accepted.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> delight, was exactly what suited her mind. In seasons of cheerfulness,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> itself. But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to do for his sisters. To take three thousand pounds from the fortune\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> dreadful degree. She begged him to think again on the subject. How\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> too, of so large a sum? And what possible claim could the Miss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwoods, who were related to him only by half blood, which she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> considered as no relationship at all, have on his generosity to so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> large an amount. It was very well known that no affection was ever\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> supposed to exist between the children of any man by different\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> marriages; and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Harry, by giving away all his money to his half sisters?\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"It was my father's last request to me,\" replied her husband, \"that I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> should assist his widow and daughters.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was light-headed at the time. Had he been in his right senses, he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> half your fortune from your own child.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. Perhaps it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. He could\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hardly suppose I should neglect them. But as he required the promise,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. Something\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> home.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Well, then, _let_ something be done for them; but _that_ something\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> need not be three thousand pounds. Consider,\" she added, \"that when\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the money is once parted with, it never can return. Your sisters will\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> marry, and it will be gone for ever. If, indeed, it could be restored\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to our poor little boy--\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Why, to be sure,\" said her husband, very gravely, \"that would make\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> great difference. The time may come when Harry will regret that so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> large a sum was parted with. If he should have a numerous family, for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> instance, it would be a very convenient addition.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"To be sure it would.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> diminished one half. Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> increase to their fortunes!\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Oh! beyond anything great! What brother on earth would do half so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> much for his sisters, even if _really_ his sisters! And as it is--only\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> half blood! But you have such a generous spirit!\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I would not wish to do any thing mean,\" he replied. \"One had rather,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> on such occasions, do too much than too little. No one, at least, can\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hardly expect more.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"There is no knowing what _they_ may expect,\" said the lady, \"but we\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> afford to do.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Certainly; and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a-piece. As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> about three thousand pounds on their mother's death--a very\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> comfortable fortune for any young woman.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> addition at all. They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them. If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ten thousand pounds.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> while she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mean. My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"To be sure,\" said she, \"it is better than parting with fifteen\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> distinguished as--they hardly knew what. They wanted him to make a\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. The\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> cottage, he assured her that everything should be done to it which she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> might think necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pressed her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> come with her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> residence, from whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Cottage, for the houses were in the same parish, could, by any\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> alteration, be made comfortable to her. He seemed really anxious to\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. She needed no time for\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and then hastened to show both letters to her daughters, that she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> heard her with surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Devonshire. Edward turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in a voice of surprise and concern, which required no explanation to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her, repeated, \"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hence! And to what part of it?\" She explained the situation. It was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> within four miles northward of Exeter.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"It is but a cottage,\" she continued, \"but I hope to see many of my\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> friends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> find none in accommodating them.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwood to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> greater affection. Though her late conversation with her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> daughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> than was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in that point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> show Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> furniture. He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh:\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> handsome article of furniture.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> furnished, and she might have immediate possession. No difficulty\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arose on either side in the agreement; and she waited only for the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> household, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her, was soon done. The horses which were left her by her husband had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> earnest advice of her eldest daughter. For the comfort of her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> children, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. _Her_ wisdom too limited\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> establishment at Norland.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> own. Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> prospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his father might\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with particular propriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> convinced, from the general drift of his discourse, that his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> at Norland. He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> have any design of giving money away.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their journey.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> much beloved. \"Dear, dear Norland!\" said Marianne, as she wandered\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> motionless although we can observe you no longer! No; you will\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> CHAPTER VI\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant. But as they\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness. It\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. After\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> winding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house. A\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> small green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wicket gate admitted them into it.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the walls covered with honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> through the house into the garden behind. On each side of the entrance\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the offices and the stairs. Four bedrooms and two garrets formed the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> rest of the house. It had not been built many years and was in good\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> repair. In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> were soon dried away. They were cheered by the joy of the servants on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> happy. It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> received an impression in its favour which was of material service in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> recommending it to their lasting approbation.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The situation of the house was good. High hills rose immediately\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> downs, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> cottage windows. The prospect in front was more extensive; it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> beyond. The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> branched out again between two of the steepest of them.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> many additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments. \"As\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is too small for our\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> present, as it is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> think about building. These parlors are both too small for such\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> added, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> little cottage. I could wish the stairs were handsome. But one must\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> matter to widen them. I shall see how much I am before-hand with the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> world in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> saved in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> house as it was; and each of them was busy in arranging their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> particular concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> other possessions, to form themselves a home. Marianne's pianoforte\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was unpacked and properly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> affixed to the walls of their sitting room.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> cousins to remember him. His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter. Their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be an object of real solicitude to him. He said much of his earnest\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> were better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> offence. His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> after he left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arrived from the park, which was followed before the end of the day by\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> their view at home by the projection of a hill. The house was large\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and elegance. The former was for Sir John's gratification, the latter\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for that of his lady. They were scarcely ever without some friends\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> kind than any other family in the neighbourhood. It was necessary to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> such as society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> humoured her children; and these were their only resources. Lady\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the year round, while Sir John's independent employments were in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> existence only half the time. Continual engagements at home and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> abroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of nature and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> education; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to the good breeding of his wife.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> all her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> greatest enjoyment in any of their parties. But Sir John's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> satisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they were the better was he pleased. He was a blessing to all the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was not suffering under the insatiable appetite of fifteen.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> he had now procured for his cottage at Barton. The Miss Dashwoods were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> young, pretty, and unaffected. It was enough to secure his good\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> make her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness of his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them. They\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> would see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> very young nor very gay. He hoped they would all excuse the smallness\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> some addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> full of engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Barton within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they might imagine. The young ladies, as well as their mother, were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wished for no more.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> silent and grave. His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> bachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure. She had only two\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> daughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance. She was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> by insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwood. She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> her again. It must be so. She was perfectly convinced of it. It would\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be an excellent match, for _he_ was rich, and _she_ was handsome. Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> her raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> set full in their face. Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> though unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attractions. Marianne herself had seen less of his person than the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> praise. His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thought which particularly recommended the action to her. Every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> circumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming. Her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sprained ankle was disregarded.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne's accident\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is _he_ in the country? That is\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"And what sort of a young man is he?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you. A very decent\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne, indignantly.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Sir John was rather puzzled.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him as to all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _that._ But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> him today?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"But who is he?\" said Elinor. \"Where does he come from? Has he a house\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> at Allenham?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> country; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was to inherit; adding, \"Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to my younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. Miss\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> make his personal enquiries. He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> more than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> him. Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to be convinced.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> remarkably pretty figure. Marianne was still handsomer. Her form,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> less violently outraged than usually happens. Her skin was very brown,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> but, from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> eagerness, which could hardily be seen without delight. From\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby their expression was at first held back, by the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created. But\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> when this passed away, when her spirits became collected, when she saw\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> frankness and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that of music and dancing he was passionately fond, she gave him such\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> herself for the rest of his stay.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to talk. She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion. They speedily\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> related to either. Encouraged by this to a further examination of his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> rapturous a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> excellence of such works, however disregarded before. Their taste was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> strikingly alike. The same books, the same passages were idolized by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> each; or if any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> eyes could be displayed. He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> all her enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conversed with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, \"for _one_\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> morning I think you have done pretty well. You have already\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> importance. You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse? You will soon\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> have exhausted each favourite topic. Another meeting will suffice to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and then you can have nothing farther to ask.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> scanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> happy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful:--had I talked only of the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer. He\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> came to them every day. To enquire after Marianne was at first his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> excuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> gave greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery. She was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> confined for some days to the house; but never had any confinement\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been less irksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. They read,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> considerable; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Edward had unfortunately wanted.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne's;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> or circumstances. In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> undivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> easily the forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which Elinor could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could say in its support.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable. Willoughby was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> were strong.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> early been discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed by them. Their attention and wit\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> were drawn off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> other had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sensibility. Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> satisfaction, were now actually excited by her sister; and that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally striking\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Brandon. She saw it with concern; for what could a silent man of five\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and thirty hope, when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty?\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and as she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished him\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> indifferent. She liked him--in spite of his gravity and reserve, she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> beheld in him an object of interest. His manners, though serious, were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mild; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper. Sir John had dropped\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hints of past injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of his being an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> compassion.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> by Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> neither lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby one day, when they\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> came into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> little leisure for serious employment. Yet such was the case. When\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which Sir John had been previously forming, were put into execution.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The private balls at the park then began; and parties on the water\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> affection.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She only wished\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that it were less openly shown; and once or twice did venture to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> effort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mistaken notions. Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> all times, was an illustration of their opinions.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> When he was present she had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> did, was right. Every thing he said, was clever. If their evenings at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> rest of the party to get her a good hand. If dancing formed the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> amusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> them of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> and ardent mind.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> This was the season of happiness to Marianne. Her heart was devoted to\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor's happiness was not so great. Her heart was not so much at\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ever. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> talker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ensured her a large share of her discourse. She had already repeated\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been equal to her means of improvement, she might have known very\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> illness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> silent. Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired. She had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before. Her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were always the same;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> children attended her, she never appeared to receive more enjoyment\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home; and so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others, by any\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> excite the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby was out of the question. Her admiration and regard, even\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> have been more generally pleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> indifference of her sister.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mutual consent, while the others were dancing. His eyes were fixed on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"I believe she does. But how she contrives it without reflecting on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> basis of common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to define and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"This will probably be the case,\" he replied; \"and yet there is\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor. \"There are\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> forward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change, a total change of\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> dangerous! I speak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> was, it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with the tender recollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But Marianne, in her place, would not have done so little. The whole\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country. The\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> carriages were then ordered; Willoughby's was first, and Marianne\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> never looked happier than when she got into it. He drove through the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> park very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> return of all the rest. They both seemed delighted with their drive;\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nearly twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> contentment. Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Miss Dashwoods. Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, \"I have found you\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> out in spite of all your tricks. I know where you spent the morning.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, \"Where, pray?\"\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs. Jennings laughed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method been informed that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> walking about the garden and going all over the house.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unlikely that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the house while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> smallest acquaintance.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> with her for doubting it.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> yourself?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Thank you, Willoughby. But you may be assured that I would not\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> should live in it. How little did I then think that the very first\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for. Must it not have been so, Marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"You are a good woman,\" he warmly replied. \"Your promise makes me\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> satisfied with her remaining at home.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that her conjecture had been just. So far it was all as she had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> foreseen; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> taught her to expect. They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> against the mantelpiece with his back towards them. He turned round\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> on their coming in, and his countenance showed that he strongly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> partook of the emotion which overpowered Marianne.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Is anything the matter with her?\" cried Mrs. Dashwood as she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> entered:--\"is she ill?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> smile presently added, \"It is I who may rather expect to be ill--for I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Disappointment?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you. Mrs. Smith has\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> cousin, by sending me on business to London. I have just received my\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"To London!--and are you going this morning?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Almost this moment.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> [Illustration: _Apparently in violent affliction._]\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"This is very unfortunate. But Mrs. Smith must be obliged, and her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> business will not detain you from us long I hope.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He coloured as he replied, \"You are very kind, but I have no idea of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> returning into Devonshire immediately. My visits to Mrs. Smith are\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> never repeated within the twelvemonth.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend? Is Allenham the only house in the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> neighbourhood to which you will be welcome? For shame, Willoughby, can\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> you wait for an invitation here?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> replied, \"You are too good.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise. Elinor felt equal\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> amazement. For a few moments every one was silent. Mrs. Dashwood first\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> spoke.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> immediately, because you only can judge how far _that_ might be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pleasing to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"My engagements at present,\" replied Willoughby, confusedly, \"are of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> such a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself--\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He stopped. Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> another pause succeeded. This was broken by Willoughby, who said with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a faint smile, \"It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> is impossible for me now to enjoy.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room. They saw him\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sudden departure occasioned.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's. She thought of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> what had just passed with anxiety and distrust. Willoughby's behaviour\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> invitation--a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> himself--greatly disturbed her. One moment she feared that no serious\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> design had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister. The\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> quarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> what Marianne's love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> probability not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> encouraging as a duty.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> red, her countenance was not uncheerful.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\" said she,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> as she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart does he travel?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"It is all very strange. So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of a moment. And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> affectionate? And now, after only ten minutes notice,--gone too\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> without intending to return! Something more than what he owned to us\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> must have happened. He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _You_ must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be? Can\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they have quarrelled? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to accept your invitation here?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _that._ He had not the power of accepting it. I have thought it all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> first seemed strange to me as well as to you.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Can you, indeed!\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way; but\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _you_, I know; but you shall not talk _me_ out of my trust in it. I am\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> on that account is eager to get him away; and that the business which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> him. This is what I believe to have happened. He is, moreover, aware\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that she _does_ disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> present confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> himself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> schemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while. You will tell\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> me, I know, that this may or may _not_ have happened; but I will\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> listen to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> understanding the affair as satisfactory at this. And now, Elinor,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> what have you to say?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> happened. Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings! You had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> rather take evil upon credit than good. You had rather look out for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> misery for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for the latter. You are resolved to think him blamable, because he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> shown. And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> depressed by recent disappointment? Are no probabilities to be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> accepted, merely because they are not certainties? Is nothing due to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> world to think ill of?--to the possibility of motives unanswerable in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while? And, after all,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> what is it you suspect him of?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I can hardly tell myself. But suspicion of something unpleasant is\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> in him. There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> candid in my judgment of every body. Willoughby may undoubtedly have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> once. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wandering away by herself. Hitherto she had carefully avoided every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> companion in her rambles. If her sisters intended to walk on the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for Marianne's _mind_ could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> themselves. But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> country; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> situation than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which had exceedingly pleased him. This was a subject which ensured\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> admiration of these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> objects that had particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> by saying, \"You must not enquire too far, Marianne: remember I have no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> knowledge in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> which ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be irregular and rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> call it a very fine country,--the hills are steep, the woods seem full\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug,--with rich\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there. It\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> exactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with utility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> admire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise. That the hair\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> among his friends was at the height. His spirits, during the last two\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> grew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> going away without a sigh--declared his time to be wholly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he left\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them--but still, go he must. Never had any week passed so quickly--he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could hardly believe it to be gone. He said so repeatedly; other\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> lie to his actions. He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in town; but either to Norland or London, he must go. He valued their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> kindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with them. Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for every thing strange on the part of her son. Disappointed, however,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> qualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her, for Willoughby's service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> openness, and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disposition and designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his purpose in leaving them, originated in the same fettered\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> inclination, the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mother. The old well-established grievance of duty against will,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> parent against child, was the cause of all. She would have been glad\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> yield, when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to be happy. But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection, to the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> him while at Barton, and above all to that flattering proof of it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which he constantly wore round his finger.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I think, Edward,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you would\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not be able to give them so much of your time. But (with a smile) you\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long thought on this\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> be a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> engage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> like independence. But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> my friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. We never\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could agree in our choice of a profession. I always preferred the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> church, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> They recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> drove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> approved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> old when the subject was first started to enter it; and, at length, as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> there was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nothing. I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ever since.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\" said Mrs. Dashwood,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Edward. You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> education or state. Know your own happiness. You want nothing but\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> patience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope. Your\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> going away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> seeking silence, solitude and idleness. Their means were as different\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The business of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> That her sister's affections _were_ calm, she dared not deny, though\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every possible\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> variety which the different state of her spirits at different times\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> doubt. There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was produced. Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> roused one morning, soon after Edward's leaving them, by the arrival\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of company. She happened to be quite alone. The closing of the little\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> door. Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unknown to her. She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> John perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> open the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> between the door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> speak at one without being heard at the other.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers. How do you like\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Hush! they will hear you.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Never mind if they do. It is only the Palmers. Charlotte is very\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pretty, I can tell you. You may see her if you look this way.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wait till the door was opened before she told _her_ story. She came\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hallooing to the window, \"How do you do, my dear? How does Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwood do? And where are your sisters? What! all alone! you will be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> glad of a little company to sit with you. I have brought my other son\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and daughter to see you. Only think of their coming so suddenly! I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> but it never entered my head that it could be them. I thought of\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> the parlour, attended by Sir John.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unlike her in every respect. She was short and plump, had a very\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> possibly be. Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister's,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> but they were much more prepossessing. She came in with a smile,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> when she went away. Her husband was a grave looking young man of five\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased. He entered the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> room with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> without speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it as long as he stayed.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> charming! Only think, Mamma, how it is improved since I was here last!\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> I always thought it such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwood) but you have made it so charming! Only look, sister, how\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself!\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Should not you, Mr. Palmer?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing; \"he never does\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with surprise at them both.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> continued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told. Mrs. Palmer\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> body agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> agreeable surprise.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\" added Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> as if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> different sides of the room; \"but, however, I can't help wishing they\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wrong in her situation. I wanted her to stay at home and rest this\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> the paper.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"No, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ushered her in himself. Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> appeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> heartily at the question, as to show she understood it. Mr. Palmer\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> then returned to his newspaper. Mrs. Palmer's eye was now caught by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the drawings which hung round the room. She got up to examine them.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> room, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the park. Mrs. Dashwood, who did not choose to dine with them oftener\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pleasure from them in any other way. They attempted, therefore,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> likely to be good. But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> should be sent for them and they must come. Lady Middleton too, though\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she did not press their mother, pressed them. Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> pretty, and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\"\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> last long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> had hardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> cause, at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of society, procured her some other new acquaintance to see and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> observe.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> directly to the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> were over. Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> elegance--whose tolerable gentility even--she could have no proof; for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nothing at all. Their being her relations too made it so much the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> up with one another. As it was impossible, however, now to prevent\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> six times every day.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> or unfashionable. Their dress was very smart, their manners very\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> civil, they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> furniture, and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> had been an hour at the Park. She declared them to be very agreeable\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> girls indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. Sir\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the Miss Steeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sweetest girls in the world. From such commendation as this, however,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England, under\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> every possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his guests. Benevolent, philanthropic man! It was painful to him even\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to keep a third cousin to himself.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Do come now,\" said he--\"pray come--you must come--I declare you shall\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> come--You can't think how you will like them. Lucy is monstrous\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable! The children are all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance. And they\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them it is all very true, and a great deal more. You will be delighted\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with them I am sure. They have brought the whole coach full of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> playthings for the children. How can you be so cross as not to come?\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion. _You_ are my\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> cousins, and they are my wife's, so you must be related.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But Sir John could not prevail. He could only obtain a promise of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> which no partiality could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself. Her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> resentment of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for a short time made her feel only for herself; but other ideas,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart? No; whatever it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> might once have been, she could not believe it such at present. His\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> over him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he could not be\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His imprudence\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have deprived\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> hearing that condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> without a settled habitation of her own. Since the death of her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> husband, who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> town, she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> near Portman Square. Towards this home, she began on the approach of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> January to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> accompany her. Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sister, and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations. The reason\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that time of the year. Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> surprise, and repeated her invitation immediately.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I _do_\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> upon it. Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> shan't put myself at all out of my way for you. It will only be\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> if you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> go with one of my daughters. I am sure your mother will not object to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> you; and if I don't get one of you at least well married before I have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> done with you, it shall not be my fault. I shall speak a good word for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> you to all the young men, you may depend upon it.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I have a notion,\" said Sir John, \"that Miss Marianne would not object\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it. It is very\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwood does not wish it. So I would advise you two, to set off for\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Nay,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> That Marianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> from this separation.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,\" said Elinor, \"you\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings's\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"That is very true,\" replied her mother, \"but of her society,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings,\" said\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> to the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> domestic hours. To this determination she was the more easily\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> any unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I will have you _both_ go,\" said Mrs. Dashwood; \"these objections are\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nonsensical. You will have much pleasure in being in London, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> anticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> acquaintance with her sister-in-law's family.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> this attack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> begin her design by saying, as calmly as she could, \"I like Edward\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her eyes in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her tongue.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> invitation should be fully accepted. Mrs. Jennings received the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> information with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her. Sir John was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> being alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> London, was something. Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> delighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their lives as this intelligence made them.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> less reluctance than she had expected to feel. With regard to herself,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> herself to distrust the consequence.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> beginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> without wondering at her own situation, so short had their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> acquaintance with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> measure only a few days before! But these objections had all, with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> beamed in the eyes of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> prospect, how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to have the same animating object in view, the same possibility of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hope. A short, a very short time however must now decide what\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby's intentions were; in all probability he was already in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> town. Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> new light as to his character which her own observation or the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> intelligence of others could give her, but likewise upon watching his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention, as to ascertain\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> what he was and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Should the result of her observations be unfavourable, she was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister; should it be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> otherwise, her exertions would be of a different nature--she must then\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> learn to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> exclusively addressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> therefore, Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which she had assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with all possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ease and enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> choose their own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to be released,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> after such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> apartment. It had formerly been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> effect.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mother, and sat down for that purpose. In a few moments Marianne did\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the same. \"I am writing home, Marianne,\" said Elinor; \"had not you\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> better defer your letter for a day or two?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I am _not_ going to write to my mother,\" replied Marianne, hastily,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> engaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> no more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> eager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conveyed for her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> once.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> agitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely eat any\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> much engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The tea things were brought in, and already had Marianne been\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> other house, Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> approach, and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door. Every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds; she opened\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs, and after listening\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> half a minute, returned into the room in all the agitation which a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conviction of having heard him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming, \"Oh,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!\" and seemed almost ready to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> throw herself into his arms, when Colonel Brandon appeared.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> immediately left the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disappointment in seeing him. She instantly saw that it was not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unnoticed by him, that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> room, with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Is your sister ill?\" said he.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> about their journey, and the friends they had left behind.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whether\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> something, she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> him last. \"Yes,\" he replied, with some embarrassment, \"almost ever\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> since; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> has never been in my power to return to Barton.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the subject than she had ever felt.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Jennings soon came in. \"Oh! Colonel,\" said she, with her usual\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> noisy cheerfulness, \"I am monstrous glad to see you--sorry I could not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> come before--beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> but there is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> you will not be sorry to hear. I do not know what you and Mr.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby will do between you about her. Ay, it is a fine thing to be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> young and handsome. Well! I was young once, but I never was very\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> handsome--worse luck for me. However, I got a very good husband, and I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> don't know what the greatest beauty can do more. Ah! poor man! he has\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been dead these eight years and better. But Colonel, where have you\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been to since we parted? And how does your business go on? Come, come,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> let's have no secrets among friends.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> without satisfying her in any. Elinor now began to make the tea, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne was obliged to appear again.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again. So surprised at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> along; so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation after\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> having declined her own, though at the same time she would never have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> forgiven them if they had not come!\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,\" said she; \"What do you think\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side, and in laughter without cause on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Palmer's, it was proposed by the latter that they should all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> at first was induced to go likewise.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch. In Bond\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> from all that interested and occupied the others. Restless and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> dissatisfied every where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> any article of purchase, however it might equally concern them both:\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she received no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> home again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild to buy all, could determine on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> none, and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> when Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sorrowful countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> there.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?\" said she to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the footman who then entered with the parcels. She was answered in the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> negative. \"Are you quite sure of it?\" she replied. \"Are you certain\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The man replied that none had.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"How very odd!\" said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> turned away to the window.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"How odd, indeed!\" repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sister with uneasiness. \"If she had not known him to be in town she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> would not have written to him, as she did; she would have written to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Combe Magna; and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nor write! Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> engagement between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> carried on in so doubtful, so mysterious a manner! I long to inquire;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and how will _my_ interference be borne.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> serious enquiry into the affair.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimate\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> acquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for the others. Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> would never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> own disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> expectation and the pain of disappointment. She sometimes endeavoured\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> forwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"If this open weather holds much longer,\" said Mrs. Jennings, when\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they met at breakfast the following morning, \"Sir John will not like\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> leaving Barton next week; 'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> day's pleasure. Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to take it so much to heart.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"That is true,\" cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the window as she spoke, to examine the day. \"I had not thought of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that. This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"It is charming weather for _them_ indeed,\" she continued, as she sat\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance. \"How much they\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> must enjoy it! But\" (with a little return of anxiety) \"it cannot be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> expected to last long. At this time of the year, and after such a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. Frosts\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> will soon set in, and in all probability with severity. In another day\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer--nay,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> perhaps it may freeze tonight!\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"At any rate,\" said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> seeing her sister's thoughts as clearly as she did, \"I dare say we\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you we do. Mary always has her own way.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"And now,\" silently conjectured Elinor, \"she will write to Combe by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> this day's post.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But if she _did_, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact. Whatever the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> contentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in spirits; happy\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of a frost.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Jennings's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> air.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Don't you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> seems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> even in my muff. It was not so yesterday, I think. The clouds seem\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> clear afternoon.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> approaching frost.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. Every thing in her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's regret,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions. Pleased\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> real enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> home or abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> concern his continued regard for her sister. She feared it was a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> strengthening regard. It grieved her to see the earnestness with which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> he often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> when at Barton.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was also arrived. His card was on the table when they came in from the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> morning's drive.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Good God!\" cried Marianne, \"he has been here while we were out.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to say, \"Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow.\" But Marianne\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> seemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with the precious card.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. From\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> this moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> every hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing. She insisted on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> being left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Street during their absence; but a moment's glance at her sister when\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> second visit there. A note was just then brought in, and laid on the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> table.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"For me!\" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"No, ma'am, for my mistress.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"You are expecting a letter, then?\" said Elinor, unable to be longer\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> silent.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Yes, a little--not much.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> After a short pause. \"You have no confidence in me, Marianne.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from _you_--you who have confidence in no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> one!\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Me!\" returned Elinor in some confusion; \"indeed, Marianne, I have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nothing to tell.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Nor I,\" answered Marianne with energy, \"our situations then are\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> alike. We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> press for greater openness in Marianne.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> aloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Street the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> cousins the following evening. Business on Sir John's part, and a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> violent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> amusement abroad, than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in her absence.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> young people, and to amuse them with a ball. This was an affair,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. In the country, an\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> therefore never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their entrance. He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of the room. Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> entered: it was enough--_he_ was not there--and she sat down, equally\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ill-disposed to receive or communicate pleasure. After they had been\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town, though\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to come.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I thought you were both in Devonshire,\" said he.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Did you?\" replied Elinor.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"When do you go back again?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I do not know.\" And thus ended their discourse.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise. She\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Aye, aye,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"we know the reason of all that very\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Invited!\" cried Marianne.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> somewhere in the street this morning.\" Marianne said no more, but\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> looked exceedingly hurt. Impatient in this situation to be doing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> something that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> write the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> so long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure. She sat by the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> another in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> quite full of company, and insufferably hot. When they had paid their\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> of all presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> face was crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> emotion, \"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this? Have you\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not received my letters? Will you not shake hands with me?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> he held her hand only for a moment. During all this time he was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> evidently struggling for composure. Elinor watched his countenance and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> saw its expression becoming more tranquil. After a moment's pause, he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> spoke with calmness.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> he had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which you were so good as to send me,\" turned hastily away with a\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> to him again that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm. She\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> departed as soon as the carriage could be found. Scarcely a word was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> spoken during their return to Berkeley Street. Marianne was in a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> where hartshorn restored her a little to herself. She was soon\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> undressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over the past.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her own\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wishes, _she_ could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> misapprehension of any kind. Nothing but a thorough change of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sentiment could account for it. Her indignation would have been still\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> stronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the affections of her sister from the first, without any design that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> would bear investigation. Absence might have weakened his regard, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> convenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> have given her, and on those still more severe which might await her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> could _esteem_ Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> good lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to her liking. Of Elinor's distress, she was too busily employed in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> measuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> calmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> good-for-nothing fellow! I have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylor told\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular friend\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and I was almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I can say\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> heart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it. I\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> only young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> you will never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won't disturb her\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> supposed her young friend's affliction could be increased by noise.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> which her sister could not make or return for herself. Their good\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> friend saw that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> therefore, with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> favourite child on the last day of its holidays. Marianne was to have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the best place by the fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in the house, and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne, she could stay no longer. With a hasty exclamation of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Misery, and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"Poor soul!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, \"how it\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> would send all over the town for it. Well, it is the oddest thing to\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> quiet rest before she left her.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence. Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Jennings was not struck by the same thought; for soon after his\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. Two ladies\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The name\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> no longer to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> more:--as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural. She resigned\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that Marianne\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> seemed to show by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _was_ carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> called, in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> violently irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Her mind did become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> designs might _once_ have been on herself, preyed altogether so much\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> on her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> felt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> open and most frequent confession of them.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> answering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor's. Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> fortitude under this misfortune. Bad indeed must the nature of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne's affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _she_ could wish her not to indulge!\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> him there. She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> comprise at least five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> objects, and of company, which could not be procured at Barton, would\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> times, into some interest beyond herself, and even into some\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> amusement, much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> friends. Design could never bring them in each other's way: negligence\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> first as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> one.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it right that they should sometimes see their brother.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's opinion, and she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> perfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> her ever knowing a moment's rest.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> evil to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> other hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Edward entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness, it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> name mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> after day to the indignation of them all.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Sir John, could not have thought it possible. \"A man of whom he had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> always had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> did not believe there was a bolder rider in England! It was an\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unaccountable business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shown in procuring all the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I believe about two thousand a year.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Two thousand a-year;\" and then working himself up to a pitch of\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. A very little\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> voice to an important whisper, \"will be exceedingly welcome to _all\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> the match takes place. The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds. A very desirable\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in time. A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. To give\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> you another instance of her liberality:--The other day, as soon as we\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> came to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> now, she put bank-notes into Fanny's hands to the amount of two\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> great expense while we are here.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> considerable; but your income is a large one.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose. I do not mean to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> will in time be better. The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> on, is a most serious drain. And then I have made a little purchase\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> within this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> where old Gibson used to live. The land was so very desirable for me\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> felt it my duty to buy it. I could not have answered it to my\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conscience to let it fall into any other hands. A man must pay for his\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Why, I hope not that. I might have sold it again, the next day, for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker's\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Stanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> but, in consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the most charming women in the world!\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood. There was a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Jennings, and to _her_ she appeared nothing more than a little\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> proud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> say to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Street, she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not choose to ask,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion. The\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> intelligence however, which _she_ would not give, soon flowed from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> another quarter. Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor's compassion\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> on being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and Mrs. Dashwood. He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be told, they could do nothing at present but write.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street. Twice was his card found on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the table, when they returned from their morning's engagements. Elinor\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> missed him.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that, though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to give them--a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> invited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> good house for three months. Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> invited likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Brandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> received his eager civilities with some surprise, but much more\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pleasure. They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> whether her sons were to be of the party. The expectation of seeing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _her_, however, was enough to make her interested in the engagement;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for though she could now meet Edward's mother without that strong\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction, though\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> herself, her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars, her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> agreeable had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> certainly not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Street; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known, that their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> visit should begin a few days before the party took place.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> might not have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> table; but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> who had long wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties, and to have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> an opportunity of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in her life, than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> On Elinor its effect was very different. She began immediately to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> knew how she could bear it!\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> certainly not at all on truth. They were relieved however, not by her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> when they were together.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to this formidable mother-in-law.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!\" said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> together--for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that they all followed the servant at the same time--\"There is nobody\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> here but you, that can feel for me. I declare I can hardly stand. Good\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> depends on--that is to be my mother!\"--\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her own,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect. Her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> complexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the strong characters of pride and ill nature. She was not a woman of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> many words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> spirited determination of disliking her at all events.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor could not _now_ be made unhappy by this behaviour. A few months\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Ferrars' power to distress her by it now; and the difference of her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> manners to the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to humble her more, only amused her. She could not but smile to see\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> person--for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> had they known as much as she did, they would have been most anxious\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them, sat pointedly slighted by both. But while she smiled at a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> graciousness so misapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> folly from which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> despising them all four.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Steele wanted only to be teased about Dr. Davies to be perfectly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> happy.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thing bespoke the Mistress's inclination for show, and the Master's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ability to support it. In spite of the improvements and additions\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which were making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> tried to infer from it; no poverty of any kind, except of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conversation, appeared; but there, the deficiency was considerable.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and his wife had still less. But there was no peculiar disgrace in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> this; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for being agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> poverty was particularly evident, for the gentlemen _had_ supplied the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> discourse with some variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one subject only\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> engaged the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> heights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's second son William,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> who were nearly of the same age.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Had both the children been there, the affair might have been\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> determined too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> present, it was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion, and to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> repeat it over and over again as often as they liked.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The parties stood thus:--\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> tallest, politely decided in favour of the other. The two\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity, were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> equally earnest in support of their own descendant.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> fast as she could, in favour of each.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on William's side, by which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> called on for her's, offended them all, by declaring that she had no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> pair of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> screens, catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> gentlemen into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Brandon for his admiration.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"These are done by my eldest sister,\" said he; \"and you, as a man of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them. I do not know whether\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> you have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> is in general reckoned to draw extremely well.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> excited, they were handed round for general inspection. Mrs. Ferrars,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not aware of their being Elinor's work, particularly requested to look\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Middleton's approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> considerately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Miss Dashwood.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Hum\"--said Mrs. Ferrars--\"very pretty,\"--and without regarding them\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> at all, returned them to her daughter.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> enough,--for, colouring a little, she immediately said--\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"They are very pretty, ma'am--an't they?\" But then again, the dread of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her, for she presently added, \"Do you not think they are something in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Miss Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?--She _does_ paint most\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> delightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done!\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Beautifully indeed! But _she_ does every thing well.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne could not bear this. She was already greatly displeased with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> expense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> by it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth--\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"This is admiration of a very particular kind! what is Miss Morton to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> us? who knows, or who cares, for her?--it is Elinor of whom _we_ think\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and speak.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law's hands,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> [Illustration: _Mrs. Ferrars._]\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, \"Miss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Morton is Lord Morton's daughter.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his sister's audacity. Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> than she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sister slighted in the smallest point.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne's feelings did not stop here. The cold insolence of Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Ferrars's general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hers, said in a low, but eager, voice--\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind them. Don't let them make _you_\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unhappy.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears. Every body's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attention was called, and almost every body was concerned. Colonel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did. Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Jennings, with a very intelligent \"Ah! poor dear,\" immediately gave\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> author of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> one close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of the whole shocking affair.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> retained the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Poor Marianne!\" said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to a young woman who _has been_ a beauty in the loss of her personal\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attractions. You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne _was_\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied. She had found in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the families undesirable. She had seen enough of her pride, her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her _own_\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> other of Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her from all dependence\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> upon her caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion. Or at least,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> fettered to Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _ought_ to have rejoiced.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her because she was _not Elinor_ appear a compliment to herself--or to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> because her real situation was unknown. But that it was so, had not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> only been declared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but was declared over\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> again the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor alone, to tell her how happy she was.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"My dear friend,\" cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, \"I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> come to talk to you of my happiness. Could anything be so flattering\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> as Mrs. Ferrars's way of treating me yesterday? So exceeding affable\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> as she was! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her; but the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> hurried her into the drawing-room immediately. Her pleasure in seeing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> him was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself, and\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> sat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> should be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence. Edward was the first\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> his fear of her not finding London agree with her.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Oh, don't think of me!\" she replied with spirited earnestness, though\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> very benignant expression.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Do you like London?\" said Edward, willing to say any thing that might\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Not at all. I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> thank Heaven! you are what you always were!\"\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I think, Elinor,\" she presently added, \"we must employ Edward to take\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> himself. But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and soon talked of something else.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! So dull, so\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Going so soon!\" said Marianne; \"my dear Edward, this must not be.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could not stay much longer. But even this encouragement failed, for he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> would go; and Lucy, who would have outstayed him, had his visit lasted\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> two hours, soon afterwards went away.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"What can bring her here so often?\" said Marianne, on her leaving\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to all those intimate connections who knew it before.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> morning as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Middletons, spent the whole of every day, in Conduit Street. For their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> own comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> against the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> fact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _their_ ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> monopolize. Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> behaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Because they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be satirical; but _that_ did not signify. It was censure in common\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> use, and easily given.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy. It checked the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> idleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> despise her for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to it entirely. Would either of them only have given her a full and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arrival occasioned. But this conciliation was not granted; for though\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne, no effect was produced, but a look of indifference from the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> former, or of disgust in the latter. An effort even yet lighter might\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> have made her their friend. Would they only have laughed at her about\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the Doctor! But so little were they, anymore than the others, inclined\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to oblige her, that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she was kind enough to bestow on herself.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> woman so long. She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte's well\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> doing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> One thing _did_ disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sex, of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> perceive, at different times, the most striking resemblance between\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> this baby and every one of his relations on both sides, there was no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> convincing his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not exactly like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> finest child in the world.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> befell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so happened that while her two sisters\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance in itself not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> apparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginations\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> small musical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> but, what was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of appearing to treat them with attention: and who could tell that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they might not expect to go out with her a second time? The power of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disappointing them, it was true, must always be her's. But that was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thing better from them.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mechanically for every evening's engagement, though without expecting\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the smallest amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the last moment, where it was to take her.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of their being together, when it was finished. Nothing escaped _her_\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> minute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> without hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her washing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> cost per week, and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> could be no difficulty in it, so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mr. Dashwood was convinced. He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Middleton could spare them. This was enough to make Lucy really and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> reasonably happy. Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views! Such\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> things, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> most gratifying to her feelings! It was an advantage that could not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> expectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> towards her arose from something more than merely malice against\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> herself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that Lucy wished. Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> returned from that period to her own home, and her own habits, in\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> herself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> began directly to justify it, by saying--\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"No, ma'am. What is it?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Something so strange! But you shall hear it all. When I got to Mr.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child. She was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sure it was very ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,' says I, 'it is\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> nothing in the world, but the red gum--' and nurse said just the same.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child, he said\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> then Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was going away again, it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. So upon\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> something or other, and at last he said in a whisper, 'For fear any\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> my cousin Lucy! There's for you, my dear! And not a creature knowing a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> syllable of the matter, except Nancy! Could you have believed such a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> suspect it! _That_ is strange! I never happened to see them together,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> or I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it;' and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come--for she had\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> other, I forget who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> vanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> such screams as reached your brother's ears, as he was sitting in his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> own dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> steward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> took place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> what was going on. Poor soul! I pity _her._ And I must say, I think\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> soon drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> said he did not know what to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not stay a minute longer in the house, and your brother was forced to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> go down upon _his_ knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> they had packed up their clothes. _Then_ she fell into hysterics\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> again, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar. The carriage was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> at the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and they were just\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad. I declare, I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> have no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> will be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> will be in when he hears of it! To have his love used so scornfully!\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may. I should not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thinks just the same. He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was sure _she_ would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no notion of people's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> making such a to-do about money and greatness. There is no reason on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> such another cottage as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"Well, Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> soon as the gentleman had withdrawn, \"I do not ask you what the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Colonel has been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I _tried_\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to keep out of hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his business. And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and I wish you joy of it with all my heart.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Thank you, ma'am,\" said Elinor. \"It is a matter of great joy to me;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. There are\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not many men who would act as he has done. Few people who have so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> compassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Lord! my dear, you are very modest. I an't the least astonished at it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> likely to happen.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel's general benevolence;\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> soon occur.\"\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"Opportunity!\" repeated Mrs. Jennings--\"Oh! as to that, when a man has\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> once made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> find an opportunity. Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> shall soon know where to look for them.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,\" said Elinor, with a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> faint smile.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed. And as to the house being a bad one,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ever I saw.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"He spoke of its being out of repair.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Well, and whose fault is that? why don't he repair it? who should do\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it but himself?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> They were interrupted by the servant's coming in to announce the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> go, said--\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But, however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> quite alone. I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> is too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> long to tell your sister all about it.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne had left the room before the conversation began.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Holborn to-day.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please. One day's delay will not be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> very material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ought not to be mentioned to any body else. I shall do _that_\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> directly. It is of importance that no time should be lost with him,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly. Why Mr.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> could not immediately comprehend. A few moments' reflection, however,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed--\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Oh, ho! I understand you. Mr. Ferrars is to be the man. Well, so much\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the better for him. Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in readiness;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you. But, my\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> dear, is not this rather out of character? Should not the Colonel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> write himself? Sure, he is the proper person.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> speech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> only replied to its conclusion.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"And so _you_ are forced to do it. Well _that_ is an odd kind of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> delicacy! However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> write.) You know your own concerns best. So good-bye, my dear. I have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> brought to bed.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> And away she went; but returning again in a moment--\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I have just been thinking of Betty's sister, my dear. I should be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> very glad to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a lady's maid, I am sure I can't tell. She is an excellent housemaid,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and works very well at her needle. However, you will think of all that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> at your leisure.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Certainly, ma'am,\" replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> How she should begin--how she should express herself in her note to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Edward, was now all her concern. The particular circumstances between\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> much or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> came to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> returning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> business.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> information by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> upon this greatest exertion of all. Her astonishment and confusion\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> were very great on his so sudden appearance. She had not seen him\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> before since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> knowing her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> what she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes. He too was much\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> distressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> embarrassment. Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> first coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> say any thing, after taking a chair.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Mrs. Jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished to speak with me,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> at least I understood her so--or I certainly should not have intruded\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> on you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> especially as it will most likely be some time--it is not probable\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again. I go to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Oxford tomorrow.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"You would not have gone, however,\" said Elinor, recovering herself,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> possible, \"without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> able to give them in person. Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> reached Bartlett's Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> her life.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Michaelmas. So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> give Elinor that credit which Edward _would_ give her, that she spoke\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> ready to own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> future, would ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> any thing in the world for those she really valued. As for Colonel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Brandon, she was not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> concerns; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> scarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> possibly could, of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> poultry.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wife's indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it necessary to pay her a visit. This was an obligation, however,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> assistance of any encouragement from her companions. Marianne, not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> carriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Edward's part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> again. The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom neither of the others had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> so much reason to dislike.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> house, her husband accidentally came out. He expressed great pleasure\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Berkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> see her, invited her to come in.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> likely to vacate it soon--he might have got I dare say--fourteen\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hundred pounds. And how came he not to have settled that matter before\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> this person's death? _Now_ indeed it would be too late to sell it, but\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a man of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I wonder he should be so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> improvident in a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> every human character. I suppose, however--on recollection--that the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> case may probably be _this._ Edward is only to hold the living till\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> old enough to take it. Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> it was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"It is truly astonishing!\"--he cried, after hearing what she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> said--\"what could be the Colonel's motive?\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> have broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \"But why should such precaution be used? Though it is not to be\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for _that_ must\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> supposed to feel at all? She has done with her son, she cast him off\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Ah! Elinor,\" said John, \"your reasoning is very good, but it is\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> founded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward's unhappy match\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and her\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was by no means so cheerful. Mrs. Jennings had determined very early\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence. He\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> admission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her friend's, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> them at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be able to travel.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began. Towards the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> uncomfortable than before. Her sister, however, still sanguine, was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> bed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> complaint which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> so painful a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> accidental noise in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> wildness, cried out,--\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Is mama coming?--\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Not yet,\" cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne to lie down again, \"but she will be here, I hope, before it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> is long. It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"But she must not go round by London,\" cried Marianne, in the same\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hurried manner. \"I shall never see her, if she goes by London.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse. It was lower and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> quicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> It was no time for hesitation. Her fears and her difficulties were\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> immediately before him. Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attempt the removal of; he listened to them in silent despondence; but\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mind, he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Dashwood. Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thanked him with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon--or\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> companion whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and whose friendship might soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> summons _could_ be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> assistance, would lessen it.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _He_, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> look for his return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> spoken too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage. It was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> then about twelve o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to wait for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> rest of the night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne's side, and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Harris appeared. Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for all her former security; and the servant who sat up with her, for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> more, by hints of what her mistress had always thought.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if _he_ could\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> five o'clock--arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> communicated to Elinor. He promised to call again in the course of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attendant more composed than he had found them.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> no doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> comfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> struck a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> compassion she had other claims. She had been for three months her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> companion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> greatly injured, and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> particularly a favourite, was before her;--and as for their mother,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to _her_\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> what Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in _her_ sufferings was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> very sincere.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit; but he came to be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. His\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> medicines had failed; the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> quiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> all, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> further advice. But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Miss Dashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> from one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disappointment had brought on. Elinor felt all the reasonableness of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the idea, and it gave fresh misery to her reflections.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sister's pulse; she waited, watched, and examined it again and again;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from indulging a\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> thought of its continuance; and Elinor, conning over every injunction\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was too late.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter, she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what. Half an hour\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her. Others even\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now oppressed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock; when his assurances, his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> entirely out of danger. Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> probability of an entire recovery.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor could not be cheerful. Her joy was of a different kind, and led\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> gratitude;--but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> no smiles. All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> strong.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> look and every breath. The possibility of a relapse would of course,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was; but when she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> saw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> doubt.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> back. At ten o'clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> now be travelling towards them. The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> less an object of pity! Oh! how slow was the progress of time which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> yet kept them in ignorance!\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she had been\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> much; and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her mother's arrival, and allow _her_ to take her place by Marianne;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> moment about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her own room to write letters and sleep.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> regarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> travellers, they had a rich reward in store, for every present\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> inconvenience.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> house; and so strong was the persuasion that she _did_, in spite of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the _almost_ impossibility of their being already come, that she moved\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> satisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> deceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> view. By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> mother's alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that moment. The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> carriage stopped the door,--of her doubt--her dread,--perhaps her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> despair!--and of what _she_ had to tell! with such knowledge it was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> impossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> with her sister, she hurried down stairs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> assured her that they were already in the house. She rushed to the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> room, and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> suspended by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> command than supplication--\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--I entreat you to\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"No, sir,\" she replied with firmness, \"I shall _not_ stay. Your\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> business cannot be with _me._ The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"Had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence, \"that Mr. Palmer and all\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was the general result, to think even of her sister.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> within herself--to his wishes than to his merits. She felt that his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> possess; and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> even innocent to indulge. But she felt that it was so, long, long\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> before she could feel his influence less.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her hopes. Elinor's heart was full. The past, the present, the future,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby's visit, Marianne's safety, and her mother's expected\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> off every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearful of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> betraying herself to her sister. Short was the time, however, in which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that fear could affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> leaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the sound of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> another carriage. Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> moment's horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the hall, and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she entered it.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> almost the conviction of Marianne's being no more, had no voice to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> inquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but _she_, waiting\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> neither for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> as much overcome by her happiness, as she had been before by her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> fears. She was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and her friend; and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look which spoke at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> once her gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the bliss of the moment. He shared it, however, in a silence even\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> greater than her own.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor's delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sleep;--but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> every nurse around her. Mrs. Dashwood _would_ sit up with her all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> night; and Elinor, in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> bed. But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> irritation of spirits. Willoughby, \"poor Willoughby,\" as she now\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> allowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> not but have heard his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before. But her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful. She\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> _his_ sufferings and _his_ constancy far more than to his rival's, the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> reward of her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Willoughby's death.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been much softened\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> uneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> intelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> away, as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> infection.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved her to be, as she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> repeatedly declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor could not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward. But\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> disappointment which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which, as she now began\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to feel, her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her; and in her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor. It\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was thus imparted to her, as soon as any opportunity of private\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> conference between them occurred.\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> such, as, in Elinor's conjecture, must arise from something more than\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> his affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> others; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> past scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> comfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. To\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor, the observation of the latter was particularly grateful. She,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> share, an apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she trusted of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> contentment and cheerfulness.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> every field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> recollection, she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> face from their notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. But\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> here, Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> than pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> be connected. She said little, but every sentence aimed at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> away without the atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> piano-forte. She went to it; but the music on which her eye first\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> rested was an opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of their favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in his hand-writing. That would not do. She shook her head, put the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> music aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> declaring however with firmness as she did so, that she should in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> future practice much.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms. On the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party which would\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the only happiness worth a wish.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> divide every moment between music and reading. I have formed my plan,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and am determined to enter on a course of serious study. Our own\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> library is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> beyond mere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> I can borrow of Colonel Brandon. By reading only six hours a-day, I\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> shall gain in the course of a twelvemonth a great deal of instruction\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> which I now feel myself to want.\"\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> virtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> tranquillity. Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> This was gaining something, something to look forward to. Colonel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Brandon must have some information to give.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> horseback drew her eyes to the window. He stopped at their gate. It\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself. Now she could hear\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> more; and she trembled in expectation of it. But--it was _not_ Colonel\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Brandon--neither his air--nor his height. Were it possible, she must\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> say it must be Edward. She looked again. He had just dismounted;--she\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Not a syllable passed aloud. They all waited in silence for the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> them.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> she wished that she had shaken hands with him too. But it was then too\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> late, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> therefore took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. It was only to ask\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of the happiest of men. His situation indeed was more than commonly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> joyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> swell his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> which belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> followed, she was every thing by turns but tranquil. But when the\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> second moment had passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> removed, compared her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> him honourably released from his former engagement,--saw him instantly\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> profiting by the release, to address herself and declare an affection\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> as tender, as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity; and happily disposed\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> common between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Elinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> circumstances she had ever heard. How they could be thrown together,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> her comprehension to make out. To her own heart it was a delightful\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> worked on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> the rest. Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn. Mrs. Ferrars was the most\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> unfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies of\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> seemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> was admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. For many years of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> her life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Edward a few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> now, by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> feel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> feared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> off as rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> revealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her power; told him, that in Miss\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune; and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than _three_;\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> but when she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> representation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit; and\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> to be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> now her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> objection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> \n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> which he had always more to say than on any other, and in which she\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own; and in short, it\n </s>"}
{"text": "<s> became speedily evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his\n </s>"}

{"text": "<s> very proud of marrying privately without his mother's consent. What\n </s>"}
